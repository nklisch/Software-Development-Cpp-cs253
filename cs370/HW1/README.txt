======

A. This package includes the following files. In your own readme file, modify the information as needed.

|-- Description PDF of the assignment

B. Use your designed makefile 
To compile the code and build the executable using the command 

systemprompt>  make

To remove the  executable files use

systemprompt>  make clean

To run the program use (assuming seed is 3) 

systemprompt> ./Invoker 3

which will run the program and generate the outputs.
